  list attempts to put together some of the most useful tools and resources, and
  will grow over time.

  If you dive enough, problems — and sometimes emergencies — will eventually
  arise. In almost every scenario, it's important to let your buddy know what
  you're dealing with. This page lists the scuba diving hand signals used to
  identify emergency situations and help you better communicate with your
  buddies, with a video at the top and GIFs for each signal below.

  A superb sheet to have on hand in an emergency. Everyone gets a little
  stressed when the worst happens, so this sheet lays out all the things you
  need to record to help you remember. Just fill it in as you go and hand it to
  them when they arrive. Laminate one and stick a wax pencil to it for use in
  wet environments.

  Some time ago Dave tried to find a wristband online that would prevent
  paramedics from giving him entonox after diving but was only able to find

  what3words is a really simple way to talk about location. They have assigned
  each 3m square in the world a unique 3 word address that will never change. 3
  word addresses are easy to say and share, and are as accurate as GPS
  coordinates. This makes them useful for telling emergency services where you
  are when you're diving at sea, or even uncharted/unpopulated places inland.
