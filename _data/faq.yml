  - id: "is-diving-safe"
    question: "Is diving safe?"
    answer: |
      Diving is a safe sport when practised correctly. MUSAC follows the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC) guidelines and
      standards to ensure the safety of our members. All our instructors are qualified to teach diving and have
      undergone rigorous training to ensure they can provide a safe and enjoyable experience for all divers.

  - id: "can-i-try-it-out"
    question: "Iâ€™m interested but not sure if diving is for me. Can I try it out first?"
    answer: |
      Absolutely! We run try-dives at the start of each semester, where you can experience scuba diving in a safe and controlled
      environment. Keep an eye on our [Facebook](https://facebook.com/MUSACDiving/) or
      [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/musac.uk/) pages for more information, or check the [calendar](/calendar) for upcoming events.

  - id: "do-i-need-my-own-gear"
    question: "Do I need my own scuba gear?"
    answer: |
      Not necessarily. MUSAC has a range of club equipment available for members to use including masks, fins, regulators,
      BCDs, and cylinders. However, we rent drysuits from dive shops in and around Manchester and it is incumbent on you to
      ensure that these fit and hold air before you dive in them. If you're not sure how to do that, instructors can accompany
      you the first time you rent a drysuit.

  - id: "can-i-dive-with-padi-ssi"
    question: "I have a PADI/SSI certification. Can I still dive with MUSAC?"
    answer: |
      Yes, you can. MUSAC is a BSAC club, but we welcome divers from all agencies. You can find your equivalent BSAC grade
      [here](https://www.bsac.com/already-a-diver/equivalent-bsac-qualifications/).

  - id: "do-you-run-dive-trips"
    question: "Do you run dive trips and how much do they cost?"
    answer: |
      Yes, we run dive trips throughout the year. The cost of each trip varies depending on the location, duration, and
      accommodation. We aim to keep costs as low as possible for our members. For more information, please contact the
      diving officer or training officer or check out the [calendar](/calendar) for upcoming events.

  - id: "where-do-you-dive"
    question: "Where do you dive?"
    answer: |

      include [Capernwray](https://www.dive-site.co.uk/) and [Stoney Cove](https://www.stoneycove.com/), but we have
      previously organised trips to Anglesey and coastal sites around the north of England. We also occasionally run
      trips abroad.

  - id: "do-i-have-to-be-a-diver"
    question: "Do I have to be a diver to attend social events?"

  - id: "who-do-i-contact"
    question: "Who do I contact if I have more questions?"
