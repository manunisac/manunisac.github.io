<p class="text-muted">
  In 1985 BSAC commissioned Dr Tom Hennessy, a world renowned researcher in the
  field, to jointly produce the first decompression tables specifically designed
  for sports diving. Published in 1988, so known as the BSAC '88 Tables, they
  form a booklet of four table sets giving no calculation repeat diving
  solutions from sea level to 3000 metres altitude.

<p class="text-muted">
  BSAC nitrox decompression tables are hailed as the simplest dive tables to use
  and to teach. This four set booklet covers air, Nitrox 27%, 32% and 36%. The
  only true Nitrox rather than EAD tables, they again follow the BSAC no
  calculation format. Printed on waterproof plastic.

  Originally thought to be rare, IPO is now recorded far more often as a
  contributing factor in swimming, snorkelling and diving indicidents. This
  article explains more and ends with a video of Dr Peter Wilmhurst presenting a
  lecture at the 2017 BSAC Diving Conference.

<p class="text-muted">
  With the Spring and Neap tides for the coming 12 months, the planner can be
  used to map out both your and your club’s dives for the new diving year. The
  PDF can also be printed off in either A4 or A3, perfect for the dive club
  noticeboard, but the planner is available in larger sizes too – A2 and A1 –
  which can be sent to your local printers or copy shop.

<p class="text-muted">
  BSAC encourages all divers to report any incident they witness, be it as a
  bystander, a rescuer, or even the person affected. Multiple reports for the
  same incident are encouraged, and indeed required for any incident that may
  result in a third party claim.
